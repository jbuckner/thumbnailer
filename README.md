## Thumbnailer

A script that takes a directory of images, resizes them to their longest side and adds borders to fill the space if they don't fit.

### Configuration:

Edit `thumbnailer.py` and set the width, height, background color, source, and target directories.

### Usage:

```
$ python thumbnailer.py
```

### Why?

I took *a lot* of pictures at the Golden Gate Relay and wanted to [make a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aACiyeQ9dFM) of them, but I needed all the pictures to match up.
